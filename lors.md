LUNAR OPEN-SOURCE ROVER STANDARD

## Building a shared framework for lunar rovers

The Lunar Open-source Rover Standard (LORS) aims to create a shared framework for designing, building, and operating lunar rovers — similar to how CubeSat standards unified satellite development. This initiative is in collaboration with [MoonDAO](https://www.moondao.com/), the world's largest decentralized space program.

## The Problem

Every lunar rover team reinvents the wheel. Different communication systems, designs, and data formats result in:

- **Wasted resources:** Teams rebuild the same components repeatedly
- **Fragmented innovation:** Rovers cannot easily work together or share data
- **Slow progress:** Small teams — universities, startups, makers — lack reusable templates
- **Inefficient lunar economy:** Similar to satellites before CubeSat standards

---

## The Solution

LORS addresses this by establishing open standards that enable interoperability, reduce development costs, and accelerate lunar exploration. Traditional space hardware is proprietary, expensive, and incompatible. LORS changes this by enabling rapid prototyping, cost reduction through modularity, and global collaboration.

When our rover successfully operates on the lunar surface, it will validate both our simulator and our standards — proving that open-source space engineering works.

## Benefits

### For the Space Sector
- Democratizes lunar exploration for citizens, students, and startups
- Reduces costs by eliminating redundant design cycles
- Accelerates innovation through cross-compatibility
- Builds foundation for a sustainable, interoperable lunar economy

## Technical Specifications

- **Mass:** 2kg (Phase 1 rover)
- **Architecture:** Modular subsystems with standardized interfaces
- **Power:** Solar + battery hybrid system
- **Communication:** Direct-to-Earth and relay-compatible
- **Launch Timeline:** 3 years (community-driven development)
