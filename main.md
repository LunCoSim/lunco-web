# LunCo - OpenSource Lunar Exploration

Here is our mission and vision (Luanr is a gateway to solar system, everyone should be able to do that)

## Roadmap/Ecosystem

LunCoSim - where we simulate
LORS - rover, what we simulation
CosmiFi - where we share the results with the community

## LunCoSim

LunCoSim is a lunar exploration simulator that allows users to simulate lunar missions and share their results with the community.

Go to [LunCoSim](luncosim.md)

## LORS

LORS is a lunar rover and standard. We build it differently with a focus on modularity and customizability and interoperability. 

We plan to launch the first LORS in the next 3 years. 2 KG rover

## CosmiFi

CosmiFi is a platform where users can share their lunar exploration results with the community.

NFT Blueprint is the key feature. It's a composable NFT (as every system is made of subsustems)...

Think of Zora for Engineers
