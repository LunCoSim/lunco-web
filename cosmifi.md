# CosmiFi

DIGITAL ENGINEERING PROTOCOL

## Where engineers share, trade, and launch ideas into orbit

CosmiFi is a decentralized platform for creating, sharing, and evolving space mission designs together. It's where engineers, designers, researchers, and dreamers collaborate to build humanity's next steps beyond Earth.

CosmiFi is more than a marketplace. It's a technical standard for the exchange of aerospace engineering data.

## Blueprint NFT

At the heart of CosmiFi is the **Blueprint NFT** — a composable digital asset that represents a design or component, from a full spacecraft to a single PCB.

Each Blueprint NFT carries its data, authorship, and links to other designs it builds upon — forming an interconnected web of innovation.

When someone creates a new design that uses existing Blueprints, value and credit flow automatically across contributors through smart contracts. Designs are not just shared — they become living, evolving entities that grow as the community builds on them.

Think of it as **Zora for Engineers** — a decentralized platform where creators maintain ownership while enabling collaboration.

## How It Works

### Create
Design in LunCoSim and mint as NFT Blueprint.

### Share
List on CosmiFi marketplace with licensing terms.

### Compose
Others build on your work with automatic attribution. Every system is made of subsystems — CosmiFi tracks the full dependency tree.

### Earn
Receive royalties when your components are used. Smart contracts ensure designers are compensated for every secondary market sale.

## Core Concepts

- **Blueprint NFT** — a composable NFT that encapsulates a design, its metadata, and dependencies
- **Collaborative Design Exchange** — share, remix, and build on others' work while preserving attribution and value flow
- **Decentralized Ownership** — designs exist on-chain, enabling fractional ownership, trade, and transparent contribution tracking
- **Open Space Innovation** — bridging open hardware, digital collaboration, and blockchain to democratize mission design

## Technical Capabilities

- **True Digital Ownership:** Every engineering design is tokenized on-chain, ensuring immutable proof of ownership and origin
- **Smart Contract Royalties:** Designers receive automated royalties for every secondary market sale
- **Technical Verification:** All blueprints undergo a decentralized verification process to ensure compatibility and safety

## Solving the Open-Source Hardware Challenge

CosmiFi is solving the fundamental challenge of open-source hardware: how do creators get recognized and compensated for their work? By turning engineering creativity into a transparent, collaborative economy where designs are verifiable, interoperable, and open to everyone.

A new kind of space race — not of nations, but of minds.
